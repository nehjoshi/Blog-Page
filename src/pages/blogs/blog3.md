**Ever got that eager feeling of attending the concert that you've booked tickets for? Or the feeling of meeting your significant other after a long time? Or maybe waiting for the result of a life-changing exam? That particular feeling - anticipation - can cause a huge rise in expectation, which can come crashing down when those expectations are sometimes not met. Is there a way around this fascinating cyclone of emotions?**

## A mixture of emotions
So maybe you're going on a date, or simply waiting for the new season of your favourite sitcom, at some point in our lives, we have all experienced this perplexing feeling called "anticipation". I like to use the word "perplexing" to describe it, because anticipation itself isn't really an emotion on its own, rather, it's a group of emotions that lead to magnified expectations. And we all know what happens when high expectations aren't met.  
But it's a lovely feeling, isn't it? It's a mix of anxiety, nervousness, and a little bit of thrill, all wrapped in a sense that something "good" is about to happen. For some, it could be butterflies in their stomach, or maybe a slight drop of restlessness that keeps you awake at night and doesn't let you concentrate on work.  
For me, day-dreaming is something I get lost into while anticipating an event in the near future. And we all enjoy day-dreaming to some extent. Because who doesn't want to think about that amazing date they're going to go on with the love of their life?

## When Expectations Aren't Met
They say that "expectations are the root cause of suffering" - and when we are anticipating something, our levels of expectation reach an all time high! When you can't stop thinking about that concert you're going to attend, or the date you're going to go on, you begin to transition into a state of euphoria and sometimes fantasy - an imagination that may not be realistic enough to be fulfilled in real life! And when it occurs to you that the concert for which you've spent half your salary to attend has unfortunately been cancelled, or your date has cancelled on you, you break down into an ocean of immense sadness. For some, this may turn into self-doubt, or they may even accept the fact that they are always unlucky. And all this simply because of high expectations!

## My Personal Experience
As a 19 year old with a small yet insightful experience of the world, it has occured to me many a times that events don't always turn out to be how we expect them to - in fact, at times the complete opposite may happen. I can't even remember the number of times I've anticipated getting good marks on a test, or for an assignment. And the result leaves me shocked. Getting less-than-expected marks on an exam or not being able to do your best for a performance are things that come and go, things that we eventually get better at and grow out of. But what about other expectations? What about our expectations of our relationships and our marriages?  
Everyone is excited before their marriage, and why wouldn't they? After all, they're marrying the love of their life (or so they believe), the Juliet to their Romeo, in a vision that they will live happily ever after. But do they? Research shows that the divorce rate in the United States is somewhere between 40% and 50%!
