**Ever got that eager feeling of attending the concert that you've booked tickets for? Or the feeling of meeting your significant other after a long time? Or maybe waiting for the result of a life-changing exam? That particular feeling - anticipation - can cause a huge rise in expectation, which can come crashing down when those expectations are sometimes not met. Is there a way around this fascinating cyclone of emotions?**  
<br />

## A mixture of emotions
So maybe you're going on a date, or simply waiting for the new season of your favourite sitcom, at some point in our lives, we have all experienced this perplexing feeling called "anticipation". I like to use the word "perplexing" to describe it, because anticipation itself isn't really an emotion on its own, rather, it's a group of emotions that lead to magnified expectations. And we all know what happens when high expectations aren't met.  
But it's a lovely feeling, isn't it? It's a mix of anxiety, nervousness, and a little bit of thrill, all wrapped in a sense that something "good" is about to happen. For some, it could be butterflies in their stomach, or maybe a slight drop of restlessness that keeps you awake at night and doesn't let you concentrate on work.  
For me, day-dreaming is something I get lost into while anticipating an event in the near future. And we all enjoy day-dreaming to some extent. Because Who doesn't want to think about that amazing date they're going to go on with the love of their life?  
<br />

## An evolutionary mechanism?
To answer the question of whether anticipation is an evolutionary process, we need to look back millions of years in history to when we were still cavemen. Anticipating simply means to predict and become prepared for the events that are about to occur in the near future. In the past, this would prove to be an essential process for survival.
