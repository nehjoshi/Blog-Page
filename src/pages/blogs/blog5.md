Our behaviours and actions, however subtle they may be, are influenced by our thoughts, which in turn, are a result of our environment, upbringing, and life circumstances; none of which we can directly control. Isn’t it frightening, perhaps ironic to know that a large part of the things that shape us are beyond our very control?<br />

We suffer from the recursions of our ignorance on a frequent basis. Unknowingly, we may utter things that we may later regret; commit actions that may be catastrophic. And in doing so, we may lose respect in the eyes of our co-workers and friends. <br />

But with a bit of effort, that can change. And so, here are 2 crucial things you can stick to, if you’re in a rush to lose respect.
<br /><br />

## Betrayal
Betrayal in and of itself is perceived as a rather dramatic word, and yet, it happens so often. Under the hood, betrayal is nothing but breaking someone’s trust — being disloyal and false-hearted.<br />

It’s strange when you think about the ways betrayal can manifest. Something as simple as gossiping can cross the barrier and fall into betrayal. Spreading sensitive information or rumors about someone, without their approval and consent, is a sure-fire way to lose your credibility.<br />

We humans have always had a knack for committing sins of the highest degree, and betrayal is no exception either. If we observe history, several individuals have become unfortunate victims of betrayal: Anne Frank, Martin Luther King Jr, Julius Caesar, and many more.

## Lack of Empathy
When we understand that we are as prone to making mistakes as any other individual on the planet, we become a little more compassionate towards ourselves and others.<br />

But when we don’t realize that, we may say or act in certain ways that lead to others feeling contempt for us.<br />

A lack of empathy can often stem from a tendency to judge and criticize others harshly for their mistakes or shortcomings. Realizing that we too are capable of similar errors leads us to offer understanding and support, rather than contempt and criticism. Empathy and compassion separate us from animal-like behavior, and are what lead to more harmonious societies.<br />

Undoubtedly, betrayal and a lack of empathy do overlap at some point, and both can stem from an unhealthy surrounding or an inadequate childhood. What’s crucial is to understand that through careful contemplation and awareness, we can change our habits in order to become better people. This not only helps us, but also the ones around us, and helps us build stronger and healthier relationships with individuals and communities.<br />

With small efforts and a bit more awareness, we can certainly improve ourselves into more compassionate beings, one step at a time.
