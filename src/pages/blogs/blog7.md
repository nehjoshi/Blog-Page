**We need good food.**<br/><br/>

Yes, being healthy and having a balanced diet is important, but at what cost?<br />

At what cost are we being overly cautious and watchful of what we consume, to the extent that we lose out on a source of happiness?<br />

I can certainly vouch for my own experience. After coming to the United States to pursue a Master’s degree and realizing that being a vegetarian here is much more difficult than being a vegetarian back in India, good food is no longer a luxury for me, but rather, a necessity.<br />

Now I’m not a particularly good cook, but I can’t rely on McDonald’s and Five Guys for food, especially because of their (very) limited vegetarian options. And this scarcity has made me realize the huge role that food plays in our lives.<br />

You see, of the many things in life that we learn, develop, and eventually forget, food never becomes one of them — in fact, its role becomes even more important when we become independent. Hunger isn’t merely a biological process, but also a psychological one.
<br /><br />

Naturally, a lot of our “comfort” food is derived from what we enjoyed eating when we were young. There’s certainly something about traditional home-made meals we had when we were small, that seems to stay with us throughout our life — a kind of allure towards it.<br />

And so, simply satisfying our hunger isn’t enough for us. As complex creatures, our minds are far too sophisticated (and also impulsive) to eat merely for hunger — no, we go beyond that. We crave good food. And there’s nothing wrong with that.<br />

Balanced diets are undoubtedly important, but is it time we reconsidered what it really means to live a healthy, fulfilling life? Your favorite health magazine may come up with a better alternative for something you didn’t even know was marginally unhealthy — will you make the switch at the expense of taste?<br />

And think about this: Is it really a balanced diet if, at the end of the day, we can’t occasionally eat the things we love?<br />
