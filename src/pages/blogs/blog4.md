## What is the cost of being an entrepreneur?
A 2019 study conducted to examine the prevalence of psychiatric illnesses among entrepreneurs concluded with the following results:
- 30% of the entrepreneurs had depression, as opposed to 15% of the non-entrepreneur sample group.
- 29% had ADHD as compared to 5% of the control group.
- 12% had some kind of addiction as opposed to only 4% of the people in the control group.
Entrepreneurs are people who radicalize innovation and bring it to the public — but that undoubtedly comes with numerous, lifelong challenges, both physical and emotional. How much is too much for the entrepreneur to bear, before reaching the point of insanity?

## The weight of responsibility
When we look at figures such as Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, we immediately imagine the success they’ve achieved and the glamorous lives they live. We see the yachts they own, the real estate they have but between all this, we struggle to see the weight of responsibility they carry at all times.<br />
Andy Dunn, the founder of Bonobos, now an extremely successful men’s clothing company, expresses in the context of how people view entrepreneurs, “We admire their strengths. We even lionize them as individuals. But their shadows we ignore. And we do so at our individual and collective peril.”<br />
His story is a remarkable one too. In his twenties, after suffering from a manic episode, he was diagnosed with bipolar type 1. This was the same man who would later go on to create Bonobos.
But it didn’t come without challenges. He says,
“Friends and mentors and other business leaders warned me that the entrepreneurial journey was filled with dramatic mood swings, highs and lows. They even call start-ups what? A roller coaster. And so my bipolar was cloaked, not as symptoms of an illness or a condition, but symptoms of a job.”
He was undoubtedly successful, but like with any business, there were periods of highs followed by prolonged moments of severely depressing lows. Let’s not forget that these are people whose decisions could adversely affect them and the people working for them — one wrong decision could drain them millions of dollars.

## Is it because of the pressure?
It’s not wrong to assume that people are more likely to develop mental health issues when exposed to situations that can lead to chronic stress and anxiety. That’s a typical day in the life of the average entrepreneur.

But is the reverse also true?

Can it be posited that individuals who already have a predisposition to such illnesses are more likely to forge their own path by founding companies and self-employment? Since conventional methods of schooling, academia, and business are less likely to work for them because of their neurodiversity, does that lead them to create their own paths?

That’s a fascinating theory. There’s not enough research to back it up, but I believe there’s still an element of truth in it. Maybe being neurodivergent can be a contributing factor to becoming an entrepreneur.

There’s also the debate of whether traits associated with mental health conditions (such as hyperfocus for ADHD, or attention to detail for Asperger’s) are assets for companies and their employees. A company’s efforts to generate or recognize value may benefit from the unique views that neurodiverse people can offer because they are wired differently than “neurotypical” people.

Though, that comes at the expense of their mental and emotional suffering. The same thing that acts as an asset is also a weakness.

As society lauds the triumphs of entrepreneurs, it must not ignore their shadows — the weight of responsibility they constantly carry and the pressure to perform well.

And so, I ask you once again:
