Sweaty palms, a pounding heart, and a sudden feeling of being extremely aware of the present moment — things we’ve all felt just before an important exam or a life-changing event.<br />

But anxiety is a mysterious thing.<br />

Sometimes, the signs are obvious, like the ones mentioned above.<br/>

At other times, the symptoms can manifest in unusual and peculiar ways. You may have experienced them before, or you may not have. Either way, these are some signs to look out for — both in yourself and in others. Although most of us aren’t psychologists, carrying basic knowledge of certain conditions can go a long way, perhaps more than we can imagine.
<br /><br />

## Skin problems
How can emotional disturbances mess with our skin?<br />

Cortisol, a hormone that’s released in abundance during moments of stress, is associated with increasing inflammation in the body, which is responsible for exacerbating certain skin conditions or worse, leading to new ones.<br />

But it goes beyond that.<br />

Do you have a habit of chewing your fingernails or peeling or scratching your skin during moments of stress? That could well be a coping mechanism — a relief from the distress of everyday life. And when skin is damaged and exposed, coupled with consistent stress, the probability of developing skin problems greatly increases.<br />
<br /><br />

## Problems with digestion
As counterintuitive as it may seem, anxiety can mess up digestion as well.<br />

From causing inflammation to disturbing the gut microbiome, the release of cortisol due to stress and anxiety causes a multitude of problems for digestion.<br />

Some of these are autonomous — involuntary consequences. Others, however, are very much in our hands. When we’re anxious, we generally (and often, unknowingly) adopt an inconsistent eating routine — ranging from abstinence (undereating) to binge-eating. Both approaches, over time, are catastrophic.<br />

Apart from this, regular episodes of anxiety can impair brain-gut communication, cause nervous system imbalances, and potentially lead to function GI disorders.<br /><br />

## Depersonalization
Some things are difficult to describe through words, and this is probably one of them. Imagine feeling detached, separated, and disconnected from yourself and reality — a state of unusual emptiness and void. People experiencing such a state may feel like they’re living in an alternate reality or a dream. Their sense of time may be affected, as well as their sense of authenticity. Prolonged feelings of depersonalization may indicate anxiety or depression.<br />

Anxiety often wears unique masks, producing signs and symptoms that may not be of an intuitive nature. Knowledge, however, can help us navigate through such symptoms, prompting us to seek help, and possibly help others as well.<br /><br />
